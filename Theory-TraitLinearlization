Linearization is used to transitive dependencies of classes or Traits such that it will have one parent at the end.

1. The classes reachable through transitive closure of the direct inheritance relation from a class 𝐶 are called the base classes of 𝐶. 
2. Because of mixins, the inheritance relationship on base classes forms in general a directed acyclic graph.

E.g.
class C extends C1 with c2 with C3 with C4.... with Cn{

}

Let 𝐶 be a class with template 𝐶1 with ... with 𝐶𝑛 { stats }. The linearization of 𝐶, L(𝐶)

is defined as follows:

L(𝐶)= 𝐶, L(𝐶𝑛) +⃗ ...... +⃗ L(𝐶1)

3. Liniarization starts from RIGHT to LEFT. Here Linearization of Cn is considered first then its left classes/traits.

4.  Even while ceeating object of class dependency can be build, that takes higher priority
Ref example-2 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trait-linearization-in-scala/( here while creating onject with clause is added which takes highest presedence)
E.g.

class C extends C1 with c2 with C3 with C4.... with Cn{

}

object SingleTonObject extends App{
val object = new C with Z1 with Z2 with Z3

}

L(𝐶)= 𝐶, L(Z3) +⃗ L(Z2) +⃗ L(Z1) +⃗ L(𝐶𝑛) +⃗ ...... +⃗ L(𝐶1)

5. While solving references, duploicates will be removed from LEFT TO RIGHT. Goal is to cancel left dependency if its present in right in Linear graph.

E.g.
L(C) = C -> B -> D -> A -> B -> Z -> B -> A -> C -> Z 

Outcome => L(C) = D -> A -> C -> Z ( Cancellation starts from LEFT to RIGHT)
