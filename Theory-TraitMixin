1. Mixins are traits which are used to compose a class.
2. The right mixins order of trait is that any class or abstract class which you want to extend, first extend this. 
3. All the traits will be extended after this class or abstract class.

trait A{
def A{
 }
}

class B{
def A{
 }
}

abstract class C extends B with A{  // This is correct order of mixin
def A{
}
}
