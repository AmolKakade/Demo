- Scala Futures provide a way to reason about performing many operations in parallelâ€“ in an efficient and non-blocking way. 
- A Future is a placeholder object for a value that may not yet exist.

import scala.concurrent._
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
val f = Future{ Thread.sleep(10000); 
               "hello" + 123 + "world" }
Await.result(f, Duration.Inf)
println("Futute completed")
