Use case of HBase
Concepts used in HBase - row key, column family, table name, timestamp, etc.
HBase read and Write - https://www.corejavaguru.com/bigdata/hbase-tutorial/read-and-write
What is HBase cell
Row key generation in HBase

HBase RowKey design - https://ajaygupta-spark.medium.com/design-principles-for-hbase-key-and-rowkey-3016a77fc52d
What is role of Block Cache - Its if faster reads. Freequently needed data is kept here in Block cache.

Frameworks use in HBase and role of Zookeeper

Auto Sharding - Splitting of Big Regions for a Region Server into approx equal halves. After split continuous row-keys will be maintained.
Compactions? - Major and Minor compactions in HBase - HFiles are compacted. Small HFiles are merged together to avoid small files issue.
ephemeral nodes?
Deletes in HBase?                                      *************************************

META table
- Stored on Zookeeper
- HBase system table 
- The mapping of Regions and Region Servers is kept in a HBase system table called META 
- META table has information about which region is responsible for your key

Ephemeral
