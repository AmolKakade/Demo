Abstraction::
1. Abstraction is a process in which we hide complex implementation details and show only functionality to the user.
2. Trait and Abstract class are both ways to achieve abstraction

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trait 	

Trait can have:
- Member variable - var or val
- Concrete method - Methods which are fully implemented
- abstract method - Methods which just declared

1. Traits do not have a constructor.
2. A trait can be added to Object Instance.
3. MULTIPLE Inheritance : A Class can extend multiple traits.
4. If Trait have only ab classes are interoperable with Java. We can directlt use them there.
5. After compilation Traits are converetd to Java Interfaces
	
==================================================================================================================================
Abstract Class:

bstraction is a process in which we hide complex implementation details and show only functionality to the user.

Abstract classes can have
- abstract keyword is mandotory.
- Member variable - var or val
- Concrete method - Methods which are fully implemented
- abstract method - Methods which just declared

1. Abstract class contain a constructor
2. A Class can extend only one Abstract class.
3. We canâ€™t add Abstract Class to Object Instance.
4. Abstract classes are interoperable with Java. We can directlt use them there.
5. After compilation Abstract class will be as is.
