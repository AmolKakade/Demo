Case Class and Apply()

1. Scala provides a special kind of class called the case class
2. Case class is a simple version of a regular Java class, that is designed to provide a simple set of fields and not much more.

case class Person(name: String, age: Integer, favColor: String)

3. Case classes provide you with an automatically generated apply() function on their companion object that you can use like a constructor. 
This is very confusing as it looks just like a constructor and quacks like a constructor, but it is not a constructor.

4. In fact, a built-in Scala macro has automatically generated an apply() method to match our case class fields. 
The constructor still exists, and can be used normally too.

5. Remember, apply() is just a special function that lets us call the parent object directly, like a function. 
It has nothing to do with object orientation, classes, or constructors in the slightest.
