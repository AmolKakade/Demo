Hadoop 1.x vs Hadoop 2.x
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. JobTracker is appoox equal to YARN
2. No concept called ApplicationMaster in Hadoop 1.x. JobTracker used to handle all running applications on cluster.
3. JobTracker and NameNode was SPOF
********
4. Hadoop 1.x(JobTracker) was able to handle only MapReduce application. Because if YARN even non MapReduce jobs can run on Hadoop 2.x onwards like Spark, Storm etc.
